IOpipe notes:

LAYOUT
---
The proportions of the website could be adjusted in the following way to make IOpipe easier to use:

- Make Header smaller and remove filter & controls from the right side

- Move Project selector to the left side, next to the header's logo and right above the title of the Content block.

- Make Sidebar bigger
  - Fix sidebar to left side for easier navigation when scrolling through content

- Loosen spacing around list items in Sidebar and remove caps text styling

- Add more padding to list items to make it more legible

- At mobile sizes, the sidebar could be turned into a dock menu, similar to iOS.

- The size of the modal is too big


PAGES
---
- Functions
  - Allowing the user to switch between "Function Invocations" and "Mean Invocation Duration" with a split button would save space & allow for more chart detail & clarity when reading.
    - The extra space may allow for tooltips and extra details. Each point could have a tooltip that links to the respective event.

  - Moving the filter controls from the Header to where the subtitle is removes the issue of repetitive information, saves some space, and contextualizes the actions you're taking.

  - "Search Functions" section is a little too close to the charts, loosening the spacing between the two releases the visual tension between the bottom of the charts and the title of the "Search Functions" form

  - Overlapping colors clash a lot and are hard to read at a glance, could be adjusted to be more harmonious.

  - Coloring "Alarm" and "OK" cells a light green or red would make the list-view easier to skim through

- Alerts
  - Needs hover and focus states for the cells

  - Make the title of cell a little bigger and bold for readability

  - Visually separate Search form & title from cells

- Install
  - Add bold effect to title
  - Add more padding & separator to the end of each section for readability

- Profile
  - Remove subtitle

  - Put Avatar and Account credentials beside each other in a 2 column layout

  - Left-align save button

- Help


VISUAL/GENERAL CRITIQUE
---

- Background colors need more contrast, the sidebar and header blend together and feel heavy against the white Content section. A neutral colored sidebar with dark text would make it feel better underneath the blue Header.

- Hover states haven't been implemented & Focus states are fairly understated. Adding/emphasizing this effect would help with reading long lists or tabbing through
