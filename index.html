                At Bugsnag, I explored the intersection of design and engineering. Learning how to create usable prototypes with React, Javascript, and SCSS was a great addition to my repertoire.

              <div class="Project__body">
                My favorite project at Bugsnag was working on Settings 2.0. During that time, my main responsibilities were managing concept art and the layout of the Settings page.

                While at Twitch, I updated graphics and non-product websites to improve the visiting experience. I created graphics for events, advertisements, and social media pages. I also illustrated for collaborations with other companies.

                My favorite project on the Twitch team was assisting with the TeeSpring partnership. Another highlight was broadening streamer opportunities and profiles by making a series of advertisements about the site's expanded functionality.

                Cover came to Collective Ray with the idea to completely replace the stock Android lockscreen. We created a simple and beautiful way to access your favorite applications, based on the user's habits. Our mission was making the most visible part of Android a simple and joyful experience.

                Whistle is a dog-tracking device with a paired application. Whistle came to Collective Ray when they were still creating hardware prototypes for tracking daily activity. Together, we helped shape the future of dog wellness.

              <div class="Project__body text-center">
                The main goal was to make checking on your dog during the day quick and pleasant. At this stage, we used Flinto for quick feedback from the client.
