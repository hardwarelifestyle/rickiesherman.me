            “Twitch is the largest live video platform
            and community for gamers with more than 100 million visitors per month. We want to connect gamers around the world by allowing them to broadcast, watch, and
            chat from everywhere they play.”

          <p>
            During my time at Twitch, I updated and added depth to the brand. Changes include but are not limited to new emoticons, badges, and updated static pages.

            Adobe came to the design team at Collective Ray. Together, we created a very secret application that may or may not see the light of day. During this interaction, some research was done on the team to learn more about the people that regularly use the Creative Suite.

            At Livefyre, I did a mix of brand development and UI/UX work. This is where I cut my teeth as a designer by learning many different styles. Around this time, the company was going through a large visual shift.
